## Â¡Hello, wellcome to my profile :-)!

Hello! My name is Enrique Mora, and I've been a code enthusiast since I was 13, now a student of Economics, and currently Head of developers at Creed and Bear. My passion for economics and programming has driven me to specialize in creating high-quality solutions that tackle complex challenges with overflowing creativity. I live for the thrill of going beyond the conventional, using the most innovative ideas to achieve goals that seem impossible. I dedicate my life to continuous learning because for me, stagnation is not an option.
